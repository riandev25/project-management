# Task Accio

Task Accio is a full-stack web application for task management. It allows users to create tasks, add labels, checklists, and images, and manage their tasks in a user-friendly way. The application provides login authentication and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks.

## Main Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **NextJS**: Framework for server-rendered React applications.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that adds static type definitions.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Zustand**: Small, fast and scalable state management library for React applications.
- **React Query**: Library for managing and caching asynchronous data in React applications.
- **React Hook Form**: Library for managing forms in React applications.
- **Tiptap React**: Rich text editor built on Prosemirror and Vue.js, but made available for React.
- **React Beautiful DnD**: Beautiful and accessible drag and drop for lists with React.

## Main Features

- **Login authentication**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Labels**: Users can add labels to their tasks to categorize and filter them.
- **Checklist**: Users can add a checklist to their tasks to break them down into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.
- **Image upload/download**: Users can upload and download images to their tasks to provide additional context.
- **Drag and drop**: Users can drag and drop their tasks to prioritize and rearrange them.
- **Optimistic updates using React Query**: Task Accio uses React Query to provide optimistic updates. This means that when a user performs an action (e.g., completing a task), the application immediately updates the UI to reflect the action, without waiting for a response from the server. This provides a better user experience and reduces perceived latency.
